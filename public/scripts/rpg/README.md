### To-Do

1. Allow users to use a different model for the separate trackers generation

## ⚙️ Settings

### Main Panel Controls

- **Panel Position**: Left or Right side of the chat
- **Theme**: Choose from 6 built-in themes or create a custom
- **Auto-update after messages**: Automatically refresh RPG data after each message
- **Context Messages**: How many recent messages to include when generating updates (only for Separate generation mode)

### Display Options

- **Show User Stats**: Display the character stats panel
- **Show Info Box**: Display the scene information panel
- **Show Character Thoughts**: Display the AI character's internal thoughts

### Generation Modes

#### Together Mode

Tracker data is generated within the main AI response and automatically extracted:

Example:
User: walks into the tavern

AI: Trackers + Full roleplay response

↓ Extension extracts tracker data from the response

↓ Displays in sidebar panels

↓ Main chat shows clean roleplay text

Pros:

- Single API call
- Faster response
- Simpler setup

Cons:

- Tracker formatting mixed in AI response
- May affect roleplay quality slightly

#### Separate Mode

Tracker data is generated in a separate API call after the main response:

Example:
User: walks into the tavern

AI: Pure roleplay response - no tracker data

AI: Separate call with just the tracker data

↓ Extension sends a separate request with context

↓ AI generates only tracker data

↓ Displays in sidebar panels

↓ Context summary injected into the next generation

Pros:

- Clean roleplay responses
- Better roleplay quality
- Contextual summary enhances immersion

Cons:

- Extra API call
- Slightly slower

### Model Selection

- **Use main chat model**: Use the same model as your chat (recommended)
- Custom model selection (coming soon)

## 📝 How to Use

### Quick Start

1. Enable the extension in the Extensions tab
2. Choose your generation mode: Together or Separate
3. Select which panels to display (User Stats, Info Box, Character Thoughts)
4. Start chatting! The tracker updates automatically

### Editing Tracker Data

You can edit most fields by clicking on them:

- **User Stats**: Click on stat percentages, mood emoji, status fields, skills, inventory items, or quests
- **Info Box**: Click on date fields, weather, temperature, time, location, or recent events
- **Present Characters**: Click on character emoji, name, custom fields, relationship badge, or stats
- **Thought Bubbles**: Click on thought text to edit (bubble will refresh to maintain positioning)

### Tracker Configuration

Access comprehensive customization through the Tracker Settings button:

**User Stats Configuration:**

- Add/remove custom stats with unique names
- Configure Status section (mood emoji + custom fields)
- Configure Skills section with custom skill fields
- Toggle RPG attributes display

**Info Box Configuration:**

- Enable/disable individual widgets (Date, Weather, Temperature, Time, Location, Recent Events)
- Choose temperature unit (Celsius/Fahrenheit)

**Present Characters Configuration:**

- Add custom character fields (appearance, action, demeanor, etc.)
- Configure relationship status options
- Enable character-specific stats tracking
- Customize thought bubble label and description
- All fields are dynamically generated in prompts

### Swipe Support

The extension fully supports swipes:

- Each swipe stores its own tracker data
- Swiping loads the data for that specific swipe
- New swipe generation uses the committed data from before the swipe
- User edits are preserved across swipes

### Manual Update

You can click the "Refresh RPG Info" button in the settings to refresh the RPG data at any time in separate generation mode.

### Compatibility with Guided Generations

This extension detects when a "guided generation" prompt is submitted (for example, via the GuidedGenerations extension which injects an ephemeral `instruct` prompt), and will avoid adding its tracker injection instructions (requests for stats, info box, and context prompts) to the generation context. This prevents conflicting instructions and ensures guided generations behave as the user expects.

If you want tracker prompts to apply during a guided generation, run the update via separate generation or temporarily disable guided generation in the other extension.

There is a new setting "Skip Tracker & HTML Injections during Guided Generations" in the RPG Companion settings (Advanced section). It now supports three modes:

- none: never skip (always inject the tracker prompts as usual, default)
- impersonation: only skip when an impersonation-style guided generation is detected
- guided: skip whenever a guided `instruct` or `quiet_prompt` generation is detected

## 🎨 Themes

Choose from 6 beautiful themes:

- **Cyberpunk**: Neon pink and cyan with futuristic vibes
- **Fantasy**: Purple and gold with mystical aesthetics
- **Minimal**: Clean monochrome design
- **Dark**: Deep blacks and subtle accents
- **Light**: Bright and airy interface
- **Custom**: Create your own with custom colors

## 🛠️ Technical Details

If you ever have an awesome idea to do your own SillyTavern extension, don't.

## 🚀 Planned Features

- Support for selecting a different model for RPG updates

## 💡 Tips

1. **Context Messages**: Start with 4 messages and adjust based on your needs. More messages = better context, but slower updates
2. **Performance**: If updates are slow, consider reducing the context depth or using a faster model
3. **Customization**: You can modify the prompts in index.js to add your own stat categories or change the format

## 📋 Compatibility

- Requires SillyTavern 1.11.0 or higher
- Works with all AI backends (OpenAI, Claude, KoboldAI, etc.)
